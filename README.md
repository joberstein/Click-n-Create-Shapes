General Usage Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run this program, you must have at least Processing 2 installed. Download Processing the most recent version from: http://processing.org/


Instructions and Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the program in Processing and click the on-screen start button. Read the instructions on the next page, and then click on the “Next” arrow to start creating things. 

Click normally to create vertices. Once at least 3 vertices are created, click on the original vertex to close a shape, or press and hold the "s" button to automatically close a shape. Closed shapes will automatically fill with a random color!

Other features:
* Press and hold the "a" key to draw green vertices when creating a shape.
* Press and hold the "c" key to draw randomly colored lines when creating a shape.
* Press the "r" key to reset the canvas.
* Press the "q" key to quit the program.


Known Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since Processing only supports createShape() in P2D, the PShape “arrow”, is distorted, and the button-click area doesn’t completely envelope the image.
