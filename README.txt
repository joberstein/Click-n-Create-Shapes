Instructions for running Project 2:

	- NOTE 1: Since Processing only supports createShape() in P2D, the PShape “arrow”, is distorted, and the button-click area doesn’t completely envelope the image.
	- DURATION: As long as the user would like the program to last.

	1.	Click the run button in Processing.
	2.	Click the on-screen start button.
	3.	Read the instructions, and then click on the “Next” arrow to start creating things.
	4.	Click normally to create vertices.
	5.	Once at least 3 vertices are created, click on the original vertex to close a shape, or press and
		hold the "s" button to automatically close a shape.
	6.	Closed shapes will automatically fill with a random color!
	7. 	Press and hold the "a" key to draw green vertices when creating a shape.
	8.	Press and hold the "c" key to draw randomly colored lines when creating a shape.
	9.	Press the "r" key to reset the canvas.
	10.	Press the "q" key to quit the program.


Problems that came up during the process:
	•	Getting the user-created shapes to become PShapes.
	•	I struggled with getting mousePressed variable to work because I tried to use it as a counter, but I ultimately triumphed by throwing away the idea of a click counter and using the amount of vertices in a shape inside of various conditional branches.
